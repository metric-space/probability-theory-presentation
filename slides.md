--

>  the action of thinking about something in a logical, sensible way

# Prediction

--

>  Is a statement about an event that has yet to pass


---

# Decision

--

>  a conclusion or resolution reached after consideration.

# What connects these three? 

--

1. **Reasoning** forms _mental models_

--

2. _Mental models_ form the _foundations_ of **predictions** and **decisions**

---

class: middle, center


# Why is Reasoning important?

--

> The better the reasoning the better the  models, the better foundation one has for making decisions/predictions

# Examples of reasoning


---

class: middle, center

name: example1

* **All men are mortal**

--

* ** Socrates is a man **

--

* ** CONCLUSION :: Socrates is mortal **



---

class: middle, center


* **If today is tuesday, John will go to work**

--

* **Today is tuesday**

--

* **CONLUSION :: John will go to work **


---

class: middle, center

# The Pattern of the previous examples

--

1. I gave you a conditional/generalized (albeit hidden) statement  which I told you is true

--

2. Took a specific example that satisfied the conditional 

--

3. Derived a conclusion

---

# Deductive Reasoning

---

class: middle, center

# Deductive Reasoning

--

> There has to be a  general rule somewhere in argument

--

> **example** -> _All men are mortal_, _John goes to work every tuesday_

---

class: middle, center

# Deductive reasoning guarantee

--

> Given all the premises are true combined with rules of deductive reasoning the conclusion is true

---

class: middle, center


* **Harold is a grand-father**

--

* **Harold is bald**

--

* **CONCLUSION :: All grand-fathers are bald**

---

class: middle, center


# The Wrongs

--

1. The conclusion is wrong

--

2. None of the arguments is a general rule


---


class: middle, center


* **Harold is a grand-father** (specific)

--

* **Harold is bald** (specific)

--

* **CONCLUSION :: All grand-fathers are bald**  (General)

---

### The reasoning is trying to go from specific to general

### Another Example

--

* You are a Police officer

--

* You are patrolling out late

--

* You come across the following

---

class: middle, center



1. A Jewelery shop with a huge glass window

--

2. The in-store alarm is ringing

--

3. The glass window is broken

--

4. A person dressed in black clothes is crawling out of the  broken window

--

5. A person is holding a sack which turns out to be full of jewelry


--

6. **Conclusion** ????????????????????????????

### Programming a Robot

> given the same list of observations, would you program the robot to always arrest the person?

---

class: middle, center


### Is there a definite conclusion one can arrive at?

---

class: middle, center

### A situation where the person is not guilty?

---

class: middle, center

### The previous two examples are not deductive reasoning examples

---

class: middle, center


### Inductive reasoning


--

1. the arguments made here supplies evidence for the truth of a conclusion

--

2. the conclusion is probable and never likely correct in all scenarios

 
---

class: middle, center


### Deductive vs Inductive Reasoning

--

1. Deductive goes from general to specific (Top-Down)

--

2. Inductive goes from specific to general (bottom-up)

--

3. Deductive reasoning is when you apply an existing theory to predict the outcome of  situation

--

4. Inductive reasoning is when you gather evidence to make up a theory

---

class: middle, center

### Topic in Focus: Darling of inductive thinking

---

class: middle, center

# Probabalistic reasoning

--

>  The modern way to arrive at a strongly plausible conclusion (that could possibly be wrong) given
  a crap-ton of uncertain information or a mind-boggingly small amount of information
